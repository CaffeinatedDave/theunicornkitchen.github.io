This is one of the most straight forward recipes I've found and it's great as an alternative to ice cream. You can also add extras if you want which I'll list at the bottom as they are all optional.

Peel the banana, throw away the skin and chop it into small evenly sized pieces.

Place the bananas in a freezer safe container or freezer bag.

Freeze until solid, for at least 2 hours.

Use a food processor or high speed blender and pulse, the banana will start off looking crumbly, make sure you stop and scrape down.

Switch to blending and the banana will start to look gooey, like a mush. Again stop and scrape down.

Keep blending and and the mixture will look like oatmeal, again stop and scrape down.

The mixture on this blend will suddenly become a creamy, soft-serve style ice cream mixture. If you want to add any optional extras now would be the time, and then blend for a few more seconds (including if you have not added any extras).

The ice cream can be eaten straight away, or can be transferred to to an airtight container and frozen until it is solid, like a traditional ice cream.


Optional Extras:
  - peanut butter
  - honey
  - chocolate chips
  - almonds
  - nutella
  - cocoa powder
  - cinnamon powder
