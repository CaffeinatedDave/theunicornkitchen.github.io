Bring a large pan of water to the boil and cook your spaghetti according to the pack instructions, whilst cooking you will be cooking your bacon and sauce.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan and then add the bacon for 4 minutes until it is stating to crisp, then add the garlic and paprika, continuing to cook for another minute.
