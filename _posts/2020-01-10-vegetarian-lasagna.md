Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan and add the garlic and cook for 1 min.

Then add the mushrooms and thyme and cook for a further 3 minutes until they start to soften.

Add the spinach and stir until the heat of the pan wilts the leaves. Remove from the heat and stir in the soft cheese and 1 tbsp of the Parmesan.

Put a quarter of the spinach mix on the bottom of a medium-sized baking dish, lay 2 pasta sheets on top, then repeat until you have used all the pasta.

Finish with the final quarter of the spinach mix and sprinkle over the rest of the Parmesan, then bake for 35 mins until golden.

I found serving this with a side salad worked really well as the portions of the lasagna were very small.
