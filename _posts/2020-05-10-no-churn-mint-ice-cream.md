I don't have an ice cream maker and having a small kitchen means it's a luxury I cannot justify to myself, therefore I started looking at ice cream recipes I could make, and if I didn't have to keep churning them even better as it's not easy with a demanding toddler.

Whisk together the condensed milk, peppermint essence and vanilla in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand held whisk).

Then add the double cream and whisk on a medium/high speed until it is thick, you can then add the food colouring if you wish until it reaches the green colour you desire.

Continue to whisk until the mixture is very thick and holds itself. Fold in the chopped chocolate and pour into a freezer proof container with a lid or clingfilm covering it.

Freeze for at least 6-8 hours and remove from the freezer around 30 minutes before serving and store in the fridge as it will be very hard straight from the freezer.
