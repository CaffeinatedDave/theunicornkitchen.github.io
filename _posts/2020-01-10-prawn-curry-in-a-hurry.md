Preheat the oven to 200 degrees

Chop the pepper into large slices, the aubergine into slices, and the red onion into quarters, separating out the individual pieces from the rings.

In a large baking pan, add the chicken breasts, nicely spaced.

Add the tomatoes (baby tomatoes will do, but I prefer the taste of plum tomatoes) around the chicken, followed by the aubergine slices, and then the slices of pepper and onion

Drizzle over some olive oil, and cover with the salt, pepper, paprika and oregano (all to taste)

Put pan in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until the juices of the chicken run clear at their thickest point when skewered (165 degrees F, for those of you with meat thermometers).

Serve immediately - take the chicken and veg out of the pan and onto the plate, and then drizzle over the remaining juices from the pan.
