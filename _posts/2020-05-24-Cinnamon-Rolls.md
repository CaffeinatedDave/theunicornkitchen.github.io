Preheat an oven to 180C, and grease a 20cm square pan with butter - it'll help if it's one with a removable base as the cinnamon sugar mix gets quite sticky.

Mix the flour, sugar and cinnamon together into a large mixing bowl. In a smaller bowl, put the butter into the microwave for just long enough for it to melt, then add the milk and egg yolks before whisking together thoroughly. Take the milk mix and slowly add to the flour in the bowl. Mix together into a dough - if it feels too sticky add a bit more flour. Roll it out to about 1cm thick, and roughly 30cm across, then leave to rest while you make the filling.

For the filling, melt the butter in a bowl as above, then add the rest of the ingredients to make a thick paste. Pour this into the middle of the rolled out dough, and spread evenly. Roll up the dough and cut into 9 equal sized pieces. Place into a 3x3 grid in your 20cm pan, leaving plenty of space between each of them. Cook for 30-35 minutes, until the dough turns golden brown.

Once cooled, make icing using icing sugar and water and pour over liberally. (Needs a better icing - possibly something with mascarpone? Will update when it works...)
