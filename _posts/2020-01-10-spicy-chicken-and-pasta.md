ingredients:
  - 2 small chicken breasts
  - 1 tsp dried oregano
  - 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
  - olive oil
  - 120g dry penne pasta
  - extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 1/2 tbsp red wine vinegar
  - 1/2 finely diced red onion
  - 1/2 small clove of crushed garlic
  - 2 handfuls rocket
  - a small bunch of coriander
  - a small bunch of flat-leaf parsley

Boil a pan of water and add the pasta once the water is rolling, remember to stir to ensure the pasta does not stick to the pan or burn. In total the pasta will cook for 10-13 minutes (whilst you are carrying out the rest of the cooking) and will need to be drained before serving.

Lay the two chicken breasts between clingfilm and bash until they are 1cm thick.

Put in a bowl with the oregano, chilli flakes, some seasoning and 2 tsp olive oil.

Whisk 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil and the red wine vinegar together with some seasoning in a bowl and add the red onion and garlic. This is the dressing and can be left to one side for now.

Heat a frying pan to high and fry the chicken pieces for 3-4 minutes on each side until chargrilled and cooked through.

Rest on a plate for 2 minutes before slicing.

Add the rocket, coriander and parsley leaves to the dressing and toss well.

Pile onto plates, along with the pasta and top with the sliced chicken and any resting juices.
