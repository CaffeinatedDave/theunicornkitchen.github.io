Start off by boiling water in a large saucepan, once the water is boiling tip in your rice, remember to regularly stir the rice so that it will not stick or burn.

After 10 minutes drizzle some oil from the curry paste jar into a wok or large frying pan and gently heat. You will not need any other oil.

Add the onion and cook on a low heat for 4 mins, then stir in the paste and cook for a few mins longer.

Add the prawns and tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Ensure that if you are using raw prawns you simmer until they have changed colour and are cooked through.

Drain the rice and serve, then pour the curry over the rice. I personally made a dip in the rice for the curry to sit on.

If like us one of you prefer hotter curry I kept a portion of the curry in the wok and added an extra half of a tablespoon of curry paste to the wok and gave it 2 extra minutes to cook, this was a perfect time to serve drinks and ensure that the other portion had cooled down enough to eat straight away (mine was the portion that had time to cool down).

Finally add the coriander to the top of the curry and serve.
