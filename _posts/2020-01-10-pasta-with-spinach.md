Boil a pan of water and add the pasta once the water is rolling, remember to stir to ensure the pasta does not stick to the pan or burn. In total the pasta will cook for 10-13 minutes (whilst you are carrying out the rest of the cooking) and will need to be drained before serving.

Meanwhile, boil the kettle and tip the spinach into a large colander. Pour on boiling water until itâ€™s completely wilted (you may need 2 kettles of water), then cool under cold water and press the spinach into a ball, squeezing out all the water. Roughly chop the spinach and set aside.

Very gently heat the oil and garlic in a small pan for a few mins until it just starts to brown, then add the vinegar, letting it bubble for 1 minute, then turn off the heat until the pasta is drained. 

In a large bowl, toss the pasta with the garlicky oil, spinach, pesto and the grated Parmesan. If you prefer you could add a small amount of water to loosen everything, however I preferred it without adding any water.

Serve in bowls along with the Parmesan shavings and chilli flakes, plus more olive oil for drizzling.
